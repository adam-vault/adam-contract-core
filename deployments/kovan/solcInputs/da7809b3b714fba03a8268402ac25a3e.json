Vote power can be delegated either\n * by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting\n * power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}.\n *\n * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it\n * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.\n *\n * _Available since v4.2._\n */\nabstract contract ERC20VotesUpgradeable is Initializable, IVotesUpgradeable, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n    function __ERC20Votes_init() internal onlyInitializing {\n    }\n\n    function __ERC20Votes_init_unchained() internal onlyInitializing {\n    }\n    struct Checkpoint {\n        uint32 fromBlock;\n        uint224 votes;\n    }\n\n    bytes32 private constant _DELEGATION_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\"Delegation(address delegatee,uint256 nonce,uint256 expiry)\");\n\n    mapping(address => address) private _delegates;\n    mapping(address => Checkpoint[]) private _checkpoints;\n    Checkpoint[] private _totalSupplyCheckpoints;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Get the `pos`-th checkpoint for `account`.\n     */\n    function checkpoints(address account, uint32 pos) public view virtual returns (Checkpoint memory) {\n        return _checkpoints[account][pos];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Get number of checkpoints for `account`.\n     */\n    function numCheckpoints(address account) public view virtual returns (uint32) {\n        return SafeCastUpgradeable.toUint32(_checkpoints[account].length);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Get the address `account` is currently delegating to.\n     */\n    function delegates(address account) public view virtual override returns (address) {\n        return _delegates[account];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Gets the current votes balance for `account`\n     */\n    function getVotes(address account) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 pos = _checkpoints[account].length;\n        return pos == 0 ? 0 : _checkpoints[account][pos - 1].votes;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Retrieve the number of votes for `account` at the end of `blockNumber`.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `blockNumber` must have been already mined\n     */\n    function getPastVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {\n        require(blockNumber < block.number, \"ERC20Votes: block not yet mined\");\n        return _checkpointsLookup(_checkpoints[account], blockNumber);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Retrieve the `totalSupply` at the end of `blockNumber`.
